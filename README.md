# RGB Color Game

A robust web application, this game uses front-end web technologies for an exciting and educational game. 
Powered by jQuery, developing it utilized the core programming skills necessary for all software applications.
 Entirely self-taught, this game was developed before I even thought of attending school. One caveat: 
 the code has no comments, as I was not aware of its importance at that point.
Go ahead, [play the game](http://leahschwartz.atwebpages.com/color-game/color-game.html).
 It is a great way to learn the RGB colors.
